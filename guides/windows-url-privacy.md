# Windows URL Privacy Tips

- Prefer copying “clean” links (strip `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`). The userscript handles most cases in-browser.
- When sharing links, test them in a private window first—tracking params often appear after redirects.
- Consider using a privacy-friendly default browser profile (no auto sign-in / no password sync).
